approach and design:

the most naive one is to give the entire grid to the llm and attempt to let it decide directly

- maybe give the llm only options that can reach the goal if it takes them
- do i want to use A-star here?
- the llm need to make a request every step, not every


get all possible reward locations, their distance from the goal and the distance to them



questions:
    does the agent not have access to the number of steps by design?
